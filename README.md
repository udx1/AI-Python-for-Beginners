Repository for Coursera course 'AI Python for Beginners' graded assignments.

I thoroughly enjoyed this short course and  key highlights to me are

1) Beginner friendly, but covers advanced topics like calling LLM's and scraping data from internet. 
2) Hands on Lab work.
3) Chat with Coursera coach - Very useful, relates to the paradigm shift in coding. One need not be an expert in coding anymore, with Chatbot beside, any one code and develope applications.
